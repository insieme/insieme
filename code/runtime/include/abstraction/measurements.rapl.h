/*
 *
 * General instructions on how to do energy measurements with the runtime
 * instrumentation system:
 *
 * Currently the RAPL readings are only supported by Intel SandyBridge and
 * SandyBridge EP Processors. Any attempts to read these model specific registers
 * (MSRs) on any other architecture will fail. It is yet unclear how those readings
 * are obtained, most likely Intel uses a formula based on the cores' units'
 * utilization. This still needs to be investigated.
 *
 * In its current state, this interface reads the processor package energy consumption.
 * This includes everything regarding cores, possibly present GPU units and memory
 * controllers. It does *not* measure anything else like the energy consumption of the
 * memory itself. The value returned is the energy consumption in joules.
 *
 * To be able to measure one needs to make sure that:
 * * the msr module is loaded (i.e. "sudo modprobe msr" in ubuntu)
 * * the user has write and read permissions to /dev/cpu/[0-9]/msr
 *
 *
 * TODO:
 *
 * * Actually, no utility should depend on irt_* functionality accoring to Peter T.
 *
 * * verify equal results for all cores (since we measure the entire package)
 * * unify all functions and document them
 * * add dram and other parts? (gpu? probably not)
 * * ...
