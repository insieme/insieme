 * A macro file supporting the definition of metrics.

 *
 * Usage:
 * 		METRIC(id, name, type, res, desc)
 *
 * Creates a metric using
 * 		id    - the ID of the metric
 * 		name  - the name of a global variable IRT_METRIC_name
 * 		type  - the data type of the corresponding metric
 * 		res   - the time resolution of this metric
 * 		desc  - a description of the metric
 *
 * Note: the IDs have to be unique and should not be altered
 * 		to frequently over time.
