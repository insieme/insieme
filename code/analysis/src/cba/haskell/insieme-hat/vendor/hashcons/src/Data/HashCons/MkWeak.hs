-- | A finalizer is a procedure attached to a weak pointer, which is run soon
-- after the weak pointer's key is garbage collected.
type Finalizer = IO ()

-- | A class for weak pointer keys.
--
-- Creating weak pointers is only really safe for certain types of key. Ordinary
-- Haskell values do not have a well defined lifetime. an example is with
-- @UNPACK@ pragmas, as in
-- <https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell-cafe/2018-January/128513.html>;
-- in principle the optimiser may also share or duplicate identical values.
--
-- This means that a value with an attached finaliser might go out of scope at
-- an unexpected time, at which point the finalizer will also be run. This might
-- lead to, e.g., file handles being closed while they are still in use.
--
-- In short, this class should only be implemented by values with specific
-- identity, like references, and the key should be the underlying primitive.
-- The instance for 'IORef' attaches the pointer to the 'GHC.Prim.MutVar#'
-- inside, for example.
