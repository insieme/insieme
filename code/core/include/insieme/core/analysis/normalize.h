/**
 * This header provides an interface for a utility computing normalized versions of IR fragments.
 *
 * Within the IR structurally identical codes may be considered different due to diverging variable
 * names. The normal form of a code fragment computed by the operations offered within this header
 * is eliminating this problem by enforcing a fixed naming schema for variables.
 *
 * A code fragment is in normal form if all bound variables have an increasing ID in the order of
 * their declaration. The scop of the normalization is based on lambdas - hence, nested compound
 * statements do not create a new normalization scope, the IDs are still growing. The IDs of free
 * variables shell thereby be skipped.
 *
 * Justification: the chosen normalization format results in a unique normal form for otherwise
 * structurally identical lambda definitions since those do not contain free variables. Furthermore,
 * it is supporting data flow analysis within lambdas since names are unique.
