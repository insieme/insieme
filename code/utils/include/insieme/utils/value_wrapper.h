	 * A simple template wrapping a type into another named type. It can be used
	 * to realize a type distinction although the actual value to be used is the same.
	 *
	 * E.g. to represent a distance between two points you might use a simple float.
	 * However, in some cases you would like to use a specialized type to avoid confusing
	 * distances with other float values.
	 *
	 * Another use case are value annotations. You can only annotate a single integer as a
	 * value annotation. However, in many cases you would like to annotate a analysis result
	 * that only consist of a single integer (loop nesting level, nested calls, ...). To
	 * distinguish those, classes inheriting from this class can be used.
