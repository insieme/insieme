# Insieme: Compiler and Runtime Infrastructure
The Insieme compiler is a source-to-source compiler for C/C++ that supports portable parallel abstractions (OpenMP, MPI and OpenCL) for heterogeneous multi-core architectures. More details are available [here](http://insieme-compiler.org/mission.html).

## *IMPORTANT NOTE*
The master branch of Insieme is currently undergoing severe changes and refactoring. Until these changes are complete, several features will be missing and all interfaces are in flux. If you just want to try Insieme as a user or want to do research building on top of its infrastructure please use the **inspire_1.3** branch.

## Directory Structure
Insieme contains 4 main sub-directories:

* insieme
  * /code -- Insieme compiler implementation
  * /docs -- Insieme developer documentation
  * /scripts -- Insieme environment installation scripts
  * /test -- Insieme integration tests

## Installation 
Insieme is written in C++11 and relies on several third-party libraries:

### List of Optional Libraries and Software
Name 		| Version | Purpose |
--------|---------|------------|
[PAPI](http://icl.cs.utk.edu/papi/)	                            | >= 5.4.0 | Runtime system, for hardware information and event counters |
[hwloc](http://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc/)	            | >= 1.10  | Runtime system, for system architecture information |

### Preparing the Environment
You can either install those packages manually (or via a package manager) or use the provided utility which takes care of building all dependencies from scratch and applies patches. 
```
cd scripts
make PREFIX=/where/to/install 
```
All libraries will be installed in ``$PREFIX`` and a symbolic link is created with postfix '-latest' pointing to the newest installed version of a library (which simplifies the following CMake configuration steps). By default ``PREFIX=~/lib``; additionally the script performs a parallel build (``make -j$SLOTS``) using all availabe cores in the host architecture. You can change this behaviour by passing a different value for ``SLOTS`` to ``make``.

### Building Insieme
Insieme's build system is based on CMake. We assume that all dependencies installed in the same directory: ``$HOME/libs``

```
mkdir build
cd build

# SET ENVIRONMENT 
export PREFIX=$HOME/libs
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PREFIX/gcc-latest/lib64:$PREFIX/mpfr-latest/lib:$PREFIX/mpc-latest/lib:\\
  $PREFIX/gmp-latest/lib:$PREFIX/cloog-gcc-latest/lib:$PREFIX/ppl-latest/lib:$PREFIX/papi-latest/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export PATH=$PREFIX/ruby-latest/bin/:$PREFIX/cmake-latest/bin:$PATH

# CREATE PROJECT MAKEFILE
CXX=$PREFIX/gcc-latest/bin/g++ INSIEME_LIBS_HOME=$PREFIX $PREFIX/cmake-latest/bin/cmake ..
```

Several other options can be provided to enable/disable some of the compiler features:
- ``-DDOCS=ON|OFF`` -- Enable/disable generation of documentation
- ``-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug|Release`` -- Set the build to be in Debug or Release mode 
- ``-DUSE_OPENCL=ON|OFF`` -- Enabe/disable OpenCL support (in both frontend/backend/runtime)
- ``-DUSE_ENERGY=ON|OFF`` -- Enable/disable energy measurement support
- ``-DCONDUCT_MEMORY_CHECKS=ON|OFF`` -- Enable/disable valgrind memory checks for most unit tests
(note: these variables must be passed as parameters to the ``cmake`` command, not set as environment variables)

If successful, CMake produces the set of Makefiles required to build the Insieme project. 

```
make -j2 # Builds using two parallel jobs
```

Or you can alternatively change into a subfolder and only build that particular module of the compiler
```
cd core
make
```

### Running Unit Tests

Unit tests can be executed with:
```
make test ARGS=-j2 # Runs all unit tests using two parallel jobs
```

or directly via CTest:
```
ctest -j2 # Runs all unit tests using two parallel jobs
```


If everything was successful... 
**congratulations!**
**You can start enjoying Insieme now!**


Please, understand that the install command is not implemented since this is an on-going development framework. 
Instead of polluting your local setup, we prefer to use Insieme from the build directory. 
Install scripts will be provided in future releases.

### Running Integration Tests

Integration tests can be executed using the custom runner compiled in the build directory:
```
./code/driver/integration_tests
```
Integration tests can be executed in parallel (``-w SLOTS``), and multiple times (``-r N``). For a full list of options use the ``-h`` argument or refer to the Insieme developer documentation. The mock run (``-m``) will give you an idea of the actual commands being invoked.

### Compiling Application Codes

The main executable provided by the Insieme framework is called ``insiemecc``. It can be used to replace e.g. occurrences of another compiler such as ``gcc`` in makefiles. It supports both source-to-source-only compilation, as well as full compilation by calling a backend compiler. For further information on its features and options, please refer to:
```
./code/driver/insiemecc --help
```
