# Insieme Environment Setup

These scripts ease the environment setup procedure required to build Insieme.
Each file with the prefix `package_` contains meta data and build instructions
for a specific package as well as its dependencies.

The `installer` can be used to install packages, dependencies will be resolved
automatically if `--with-depends` is provided.

    $ ./installer gmp mpfr mpc gcc

or

    $ ./installer --with-depends gcc ruby valgrind

Note that all dependencies will be installed regardless of whether they are
already present on your system, outside of this dependency installer.

The default `PREFIX` is set in `config.sh` and can be overwritten via an
environment variable:

    $ PREFIX=/opt/custom-libs ./installer

While `PREFIX` takes precedence, the environment variable `THIRD_PARTY_LIBS` is
also considered.

## Using Installed Packages

To use one of the installed packages directly adjust your `PATH` and/or
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` accordingly.

## Patches

The default `pkg_prepare` action will apply all patches inside the `patches`
directory which are prefixed with the package name. The order is inferred from
the filename which should have the following structure:

    <package name>-<patch number>-<comment>.patch

## Older GCC

Some systems only provide a GCC version < 5. We therefore have to bootstrap a
newer GCC first. This can be done by enabling everything under *Override
Compiler* inside `config.sh`. Install GCC before installing other dependencies.

    $ ./installer gcc
    $ ./installer llvm cudd boost ...

## Third Party Symlinker

All packages installed by the installer are separated by their name and
version, this allows one to have multiple versions of a package installed
side-by-side. Yet, in order for a project to find its required dependencies
another layer of indirection is added.

A folder `third_party` should be located inside the Insieme build directory,
containing symlinks for each dependency. The symlinks point to
installed packages in `PREFIX`. The `third_party` folder should not contain
different versions of the same package. Example:

    $ PREFIX="$HOME/third_party_libs"
    $ ls -l $PREFIX
    drwxr-xr-x.  4 alex   dps 4.0K Nov 18 15:14 autoconf-2.68/
    drwxr-xr-x.  4 alex   dps 4.0K Nov 18 15:14 automake-1.15/
    drwxr-xr-x.  7 alex   dps 4.0K Nov 18 15:14 binutils-2.27/
    drwxr-xr-x.  5 alex   dps 4.0K Nov 18 15:14 bison-3.0.4/
    drwxr-xr-x.  4 alex   dps 4.0K Nov 18 15:14 boost-1.50.0/
    drwxr-xr-x.  4 alex   dps 4.0K Nov 18 15:14 boost-1.59.0/
    drwxr-xr-x.  5 alex   dps 4.0K Nov 18 15:14 cmake-3.2.1/
    drwxr-xr-x.  5 alex   dps 4.0K Nov 18 15:14 cmake-3.6.1/
        ...

    $ ls -l $INSIEME_SRC/build/third_party
    lrwxrwxrwx. 1 alex dps   47 Nov 22 13:17 autoconf -> /home/alex/third_party_libs/autoconf-2.68/
    lrwxrwxrwx. 1 alex dps   47 Nov 22 13:17 automake -> /home/alex/third_party_libs/automake-1.15/
    lrwxrwxrwx. 1 alex dps   47 Nov 22 13:17 binutils -> /home/alex/third_party_libs/binutils-2.27/
    lrwxrwxrwx. 1 alex dps   45 Nov 22 13:17 bison -> /home/alex/third_party_libs/bison-3.0.4/
    lrwxrwxrwx. 1 alex dps   46 Nov 22 13:17 boost -> /home/alex/third_party_libs/boost-1.59.0/
    lrwxrwxrwx. 1 alex dps   45 Nov 22 13:17 cmake -> /home/alex/third_party_libs/cmake-3.2.1/
        ...

The `third_party_linker` can create these symlinks for you, it uses the same
version of a package as defined in the related `package_` file. The folder
`third_party` is created in the current working directory when invoking
`third_party_linker`.
