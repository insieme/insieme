  Purpose:

    MAIN runs an example of Dijkstra's minimum distance algorithm.

  Discussion:

    Given the distance matrix that defines a graph, we seek a list
    of the minimum distances between node 0 and all other nodes.

    This program sets up a small example problem and solves it.

    The correct minimum distances are:

      0   35   15   45   49   41

/*
  Purpose:

    DIJKSTRA_DISTANCE uses Dijkstra's minimum distance algorithm.

  Discussion:

    We essentially build a tree.  We start with only node 0 connected
    to the tree, and this is indicated by setting CONNECTED[0] = 1.

    We initialize MIND[I] to the one step distance from node 0 to node I.

    Now we search among the unconnected nodes for the node MV whose minimum
    distance is smallest, and connect it to the tree.  For each remaining
    unconnected node I, we check to see whether the distance from 0 to MV
    to I is less than that recorded in MIND[I], and if so, we can reduce
    the distance.

    After NV-1 steps, we have connected all the nodes to 0, and computed
    the correct minimum distances.
