For now, there is only a simple Makefile, and the whole thing was only
tested on GNU/Linux. On a linux system, type "make" to compile the thing.
On other systems, your mileage may wary -- I haven't tried it at all.
Theoretically, the program should work on any Posix system with pthreads,
but expect at least compilation problems if you try. If "make" complains,
use the GNU make instead (gmake), etc. Patches are welcome.

Currently, the hyperthreading is only attempted to be detected in Linux.
Patches are welcome, again.

Please also note that gcc-3.3 produces a 10% faster binary than gcc-4.0.
