----------------

make
2: tests/
make


To run:
--------

example script:
qsub -n 1024 --mode c64  -t 60 ./BENCH_QUERY -n 500000 -m 4000000

# The input dataset is: 500000 * 64 * 1024 * 100 = 3276800000000 
n - string per rank
m - # of queries per rank

One can change the number of nodes to scales this as needed

NOTE: Requires a minimum of two MPI ranks to run

N = Total number of strings
M = Total number of queries 
To run a single node case where N = 80,000,000 M= 8,000,000, with two MPI ranks
n = 40,000,000
m = 4,000,000

Output:

Hit count: 506452
Adding time cost (s): 47.413141
Commit time cost (s): 9.287265
Query time cost (s): 350.271104
Query throughput (global #quries/s): 23387598.6
