                                  Version 1.0

                               by Andrew Friedley

The purpose of this benchmark is to measure the maximal message rate of a
single compute node.  The first num_cores ranks are expected to reside on
the 'core' compute node for which message rate is being tested.  After that,
the next num_nbors ranks are neighbors for the first core rank, the next set
of num_nbors ranks are neighbors for the second core rank, and so on.  For
example, testing an 8-core node (num_cores = 8) with 4 neighbors
(num_nbors = 4) requires 8 + 8 * 4 = 40 ranks.  The first 8 of those 40
ranks are expected to be on the 'core' node being benchmarked, while the
rest of the ranks are on separate nodes.

Parameters are all specified on the command line, some are required
(num_cores, num_nbors), while others are optional and have defaults set.

Parameter key:
 num_cores      Number of MPI ranks on the 'core' node, correlates to
                number of cores on one compute node.
 num_nbors      Number of distinct neighbors to each rank on the core node.
 num_iters      Number of benchmark iterations to perform for each message
                size.
 win_size       How many concurrent sends/recv pairs to post for each
                neighbor in a single iteration.
 min_msgsize    Smallest message size to benchmark.
 max_msgsize    Largest message size to benchmark.  Benchmarking starts with
                min_msgsize, and then doubles the size repeatedly until
                max_msgsize is reached.
