The LTE Uplink Receiver PHY benchmark is a realistic implementation of
the baseband processing for an LTE mobile base station. The benchmark
implements the processing required by the base station in an uplink.

To execute the benchmark try one of the following make targets:
  make [run_pci/run_sim/run_x86/run_cilk/run_cilk/run_cilk_pci]

For more information about these and other targets do "make help".

For the run_pci and run_sim make targets to work you first need to set
the TILERA_ROOT variable in the Makefile to the location of Tilera's
Multicore Development Environment (MDE). The benchmark has been tested
with version 2.1.0.98943.

The first time "run_pci" or "run_sim" is execute the Linux kernel for
the Tilera architecture will be compiled and the first time "run_cilk"
or "run_cilk_pci" is executed the Cilk runtime will be downloaded and
compiled (might take a lot of time).

More information about the benchmark can be found in doc/uplink.pdf.

The benchmark has been tested on the following architectures and OSes: 
o Tilera TILEPro64, Linux 2.6
o Intel Pentium 4 3.0 GHz, Fedora 14 Linux 2.6.35.6 x86_64
o Intel Dual Xeon E5620 2.4 GHz, Ubuntu 10.04 LTS Linux 2.6.35 x86_64
o Intel Core 2 Duo 2.53 GHz, Mac OS X 10.6.8, MacPorts 2.0.3
