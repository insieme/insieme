//| The flag CGAL_CFG_NESTED_CLASS_FRIEND_DECLARATION_BUG is set
//| if the compiler cannot recognize the declaration of a nested
//| class as friend.
//| Compilers such as the Intel compiler 8.x (for linux or windows),
//| MSVC 7.1 or pgCC have this "bug". It should be noted that the C++
//| standard is a bit vague on this issue, in other words what is referred
//| to as "bug" above, may not really be a bug. Hopefully, the next standard
//| will resolve this issue.
